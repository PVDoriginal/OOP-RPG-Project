# OOP-RPG-Project
Simple terminal-based RPG game implemented in C++ with heavy use of OOP.

## Functionality
The game features a simple gameplay-loop: 
- There's a shop that you can buy items from.
- A character screen that lets you use items from your inventory.
- A simple turn-based combat system.

## Features
* Items and enemies have expandable behaviors implemented using the [strategy pattern](https://onewheelstudio.com/blog/2020/8/16/strategy-pattern-composition-over-inheritance).

## Code Organization
The code is organized in a [main.cpp](https://github.com/PVDoriginal/OOP-RPG-Project/blob/main/code/main.cpp) file, along with [Headers](https://github.com/PVDoriginal/OOP-RPG-Project/tree/main/code/Headers) defining classes and separate [.cpp's](https://github.com/PVDoriginal/OOP-RPG-Project/tree/main/code/Implementations) with their implementations, keeping everything clean.
